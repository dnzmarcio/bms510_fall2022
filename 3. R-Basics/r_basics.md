## Morning Train

### Sheena Easton and Game Theory

Sheena Easton describes the following scenario for her baby:

1. Takes the morning train
2. Works from nine 'til five
3. Takes another train home again
4. Finds Sheena Easton waiting for him

\bigskip Sheena Easton and her baby are playing a \textcolor{clemsonorange}{zero-sum (total conflict) game}.

- Akin to Holmes-Moriarty game (see: von Neumann and Morgenstern)
- Solution: \textcolor{clemsonorange}{mixed strategy}
